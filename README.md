 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 üîç Introduction

The aim of this task is to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. EDA is a foundational step in the data analysis process that allows us to understand the characteristics of the dataset before applying any machine learning algorithms.

Through a combination of descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques, this task helps uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and gain a solid understanding of the relationships between different variables. The insights gathered during EDA guide data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building in future stages.


‚úÖ Guidelines Followed

 1. **Generated Summary Statistics**
- Calculated key descriptive metrics such as **mean, median, mode, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles** for each numerical feature.
- This helped identify data ranges, central tendencies, and variability across features like `Age`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, and `Parch`.
- Also examined value counts for categorical variables like `Sex`, `Embarked`, and `Pclass` to understand data composition.


 2. **Created Histograms and Boxplots for Numeric Features**
- Plotted **histograms** to visualize the distribution of numeric features and detect **skewness** or multimodal tendencies.
- Used **boxplots** to visually detect **outliers** and understand the spread of each feature with respect to the interquartile range (IQR).
- These visualizations aided in deciding whether transformation or scaling is needed during preprocessing.


 3. **Used Pairplot and Correlation Matrix for Feature Relationships**
- Created **pairplots** (scatterplot matrix) to explore pairwise relationships between multiple numerical features, color-coded by survival status for deeper insight.
- Generated a **correlation matrix heatmap** to quantify the linear relationship between variables.
- These techniques helped in understanding **feature interactions**, **collinearity**, and **possible predictors** for the target variable `Survived`.


 4. **Identified Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies in the Data**
- Identified key patterns such as:
  - **Higher survival rates among females and first-class passengers**
  - **Children had slightly better survival odds**
  - **Passengers with higher fares were more likely to survive**
- Noted anomalies like:
  - Missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Fare`
  - Presence of outliers in `Fare` and `Age`
- Recognized skewed distributions that may require transformation for model fitting.


 5. **Made Basic Feature-Level Inferences from Visuals**
- Inferred **potential importance of categorical and numerical features** based on visual separability.
- Confirmed that `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Fare` are likely to be strong predictors of survival.
- Recognized which features had minimal impact (e.g., `Ticket` or `Cabin` due to high missing values or low correlation).
- These insights help shape data cleaning and feature engineering steps for downstream ML tasks.
